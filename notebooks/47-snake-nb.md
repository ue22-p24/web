* clone the github repo from <https://github.com/patorjk/JavaScript-Snake.git>
* open `index.html` in your browser - check that the game works for you
* could you read the code ?  
  if not what percentage can you read ?
* imagine some change that you'd like to make on the game, be it in terms of colors, speed, behaviour
  whatever you think could improve the game; are you able to implement that change ?
  
```{admonition} historical note
We have not checked the git repo recently, but it does seem to have an online mode now on codesandbox; check it out !
